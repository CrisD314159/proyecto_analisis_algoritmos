 abstract = {Since the early attempts to understand the brain made by Greek philosophers more than 2000 years ago, one of the main questions in neuroscience has been how the brain perceives all the stimuli in the environment and uses this information to implement a response. Recent hypotheses of the neural code rely on the existence of an ideal observer, whether on specific areas of the cerebral cortex or distributed network composed of cortical and subcortical elements. The Neurobehavioral State hypothesis stipulates that neurons are in a quasi-stable state due to the dynamic interaction of their molecular components. This increases their computational capabilities and electrophysiological behavior further than a binary active/inactive state. Together, neuronal populations across the brain learn to identify and associate internal and external stimuli with actions and emotions. Furthermore, such associations can be stored through the regulation of neuronal components as new quasi-stable states. Using this framework, behavior arises as the result of the dynamic interaction between internal and external stimuli together with previously established quasi-stable states that delineate the behavioral response. Finally, the Neurobehavioral State hypothesis is firmly grounded on present evidence of the complex dynamics within the brain, from the molecular to the network level, and avoids the need for a central observer by proposing the brain configures itself through experience-driven associations.},

 abstract = {NMs, whose dimensions are below 100 nm, provide unique mechanical properties from quantum effects, surface phenomena, and small-scale interactions that account for their importance in energy storage, biomedicine, nanoelectronics, etc. This review discusses computational prediction of mechanical properties (for example, elasticity, strength, and fracture behavior) in NMs, especially using Density Functional Theory as a central tool. By conducting DFT calculations, we can analyze how NMs will behave across different mechanical states, which is critical for designing properties for advanced applications. Problems related to the application of DFT (e.g., high computational cost and failure in modeling defects or exchange-correlation functionals) are discussed. Despite these challenges, DFT must provide insights that complement other tools and strategies. However, further development is essential for improving its quantitative predictability on temperature and multiscale models. Future work is needed to integrate ML with DFT further to refine the accuracy and computational efficiency, thereby extending the capability of DFT to accelerate the discovery of new NMs with superior mechanical properties.},

 abstract = {Demetis and Lee's paper outlines criteria for constructing theory in accordance with systems science. This is a laudable aim but in this comment I suggest that their view of systems thinking is both narrow and somewhat dated. Demetis and Lee equate systems science with only one aspect of it – General Systems Thinking (GST) – and they discuss in detail only one theorist – Niklas Luhmann. I draw attention to a range of other systems approaches including system dynamics, soft systems methodology, complexity theory, critical systems thinking, critical realism and multimethodology. I conclude with tentative guidelines of my own.},

The “Targeted Challenges” include unsteady flows with interfaces, fluid–object and fluid–structure interactions, airdrop systems, and air circulation and contaminant dispersion. The methods developed include special numerical stabilization methods for compressible and incompressible flows, methods for moving boundaries and interfaces, advanced mesh management methods, and multi-domain computational methods.

 abstract = {Aircraft aerodynamics have been predicted using computational fluid dynamics for a number of years. While viscous flow computations for cruise conditions have become commonplace, the non-linear effects that take place at high angles of attack are much more difficult to predict. A variety of difficulties arise when performing these computations, including challenges in properly modeling turbulence and transition for vortical and massively separated flows, the need to use appropriate numerical algorithms if flow asymmetry is possible, and the difficulties in creating grids that allow for accurate simulation of the flowfield. These issues are addressed and recommendations are made for further improvements in high angle of attack flow prediction. Current predictive capabilities for high angle of attack flows are reviewed, and solutions based on hybrid turbulence models are presented.},

 abstract = {Analytical decision making strategies rely on weighing pros and cons of multiple options in an unbounded rationality manner. Contrary to these strategies, recognition primed decision (RPD) model which is a primary naturalistic decision making (NDM) approach assumes that experienced and professional decision makers when encounter problems in real operating conditions are able to use their previous experiences and trainings in order to diagnose the problem, recall the appropriate solution, evaluate it mentally, and implement it to handle the problem in a satisficing manner. In this paper, a computational form of RPD, now called C-RPD, is presented. Unified Modeling Language was used as a modeling language to represent the proposed C-RPD model in order to make the implementation easy and obvious. To execute the model, RoboCup Rescue agent simulation environment, which is one of the best and the most famous complex and multi-agent large-scale environments, was selected. The environment simulates the incidence of fire and earthquakes in urban areas where it is the duty of the police forces, firefighters and ambulance teams to control the crisis. Firefighters of SOS team are first modeled and implemented by utilizing C-RPD and then the system is trained using an expert’s experience. There are two evaluations. To find out the convergence of different versions developed during experience adding, some of the developed versions are chosen and evaluated on seven maps. Results show performance improvements. The SOS team ranked first in an official world championship and three official open tournaments.},

 abstract = {This paper presented both experimental and numerical assessments of separation gap effect on vented explosion pressure in and around the area of a tank group. A series of vented gas explosion layouts with different separation gaps between tanks were experimentally investigated. In order to qualitatively determine the relationship between the separation gap distance and explosion pressure, intensive computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, verified with testing data, were conducted. Good agreement between CFD simulation results and experimental data was achieved. By using CFD simulation, more gas explosion cases were included to consider different gas cloud coverage scenarios. Separation gap effects on internal and external pressures at various locations were investigated.},
